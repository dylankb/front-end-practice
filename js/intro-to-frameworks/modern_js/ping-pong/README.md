## Ping Pong

### Intro

Ping Pong is a simple web application to demonstrate my proficiency in core web development languages, tools, and libraries including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Git.

### Use

To play Ping-Pong enter a number of rounds to play in the input field where it says **Enter your number here**. Once you enter a number, click Ping-Pong! A series of numbers and words will displayed below.

* Numbers divisible by 3 will say "ping"
* Numbers divisible by 5 will say "pong"
* Numbers divisible by 3 and 5 will say "pingpong"

Enter another number into the field and click the button to see the process repeated.
